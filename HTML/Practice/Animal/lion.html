    <br>
    <dd>Lions, scientifically known as <mark>Panthera leo</mark>, are remarkable big cats native to Africa and India.
       They are unique for their social structure, living in groups called prides that consist of a few adult males, related females, and their cubs.
       Male lions are distinguished by their impressive manes, which can vary in color and size.
       These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates like zebras and wildebeests, with females usually doing the hunting.
       Lions prefer habitats like grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands, and while they once roamed much of Europe, Asia, and Africa,
       they are now mainly found in parts of Africa south of the Sahara and in India's Gir National Park. ü¶Å</dd>
