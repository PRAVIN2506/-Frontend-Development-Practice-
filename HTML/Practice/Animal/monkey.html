    <br>
    <dd>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates that belong to the <mark>infraorder Simiiformes</mark>.
       They are generally smaller than apes and typically have tails, which apes lack.
       Monkeys are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys (found in Central and South America) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia).
       They are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and adaptability to various environments, from tropical forests to savannas.
       Monkeys are mostly arboreal, meaning they live in trees, and are active during the day.
       They play a crucial role in their ecosystems, often acting as seed dispersers and helping to maintain the health of their habitats.</dd>
