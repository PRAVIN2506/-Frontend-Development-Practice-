    <br>
    <dd>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth, known for their massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. 
      There are three recognized species: <mark>the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant</mark>. 
      Elephants use their trunks for various purposes, such as picking up objects, trumpeting warnings, greeting other elephants, and sucking up water for drinking or bathing. 
      They are highly social animals, living in complex family groups led by a matriarch. Elephants are found in diverse habitats, 
      including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
      Unfortunately, they face threats from habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial.
