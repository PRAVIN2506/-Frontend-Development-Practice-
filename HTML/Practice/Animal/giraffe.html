    <dd>Giraffes, scientifically known as <mark>Giraffa camelopardalis</mark>, are the tallest terrestrial animals on Earth, with males reaching heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) and females slightly shorter.
       They are easily recognizable by their long necks, distinctive coat patterns, and horn-like ossicones on their heads.
       Giraffes inhabit savannas and woodlands across Africa, from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south.
        They primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, especially acacia species, which they can reach thanks to their height.
       Giraffes live in herds and are known for their social behavior, with males often engaging in “necking” battles to establish dominance.
       Despite their size and strength, they face threats from habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial.</dd>
