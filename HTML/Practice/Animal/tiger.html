    <br>
    <dd>Tigers, scientifically known as <mark>Panthera tigris</mark>, are the largest members of the cat family and are native to Asia. 
      They have powerful, muscular bodies with distinctive orange fur and black stripes. 
      Tigers are apex predators, primarily hunting large ungulates like deer and wild boar. 
      They are mostly solitary animals, with males and females only coming together for mating. 
      Tigers inhabit a variety of environments, from tropical forests to grasslands and even mangrove swamps. 
      Unfortunately, they are listed as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.</dd>
